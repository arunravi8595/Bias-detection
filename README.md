# Find bias in UK police using comparative references and ML algorithm


# Abstract
There are many contradictory incidents and researches
that complain about the prejudice tendency of police
based on the race, gender and ethnicity. We are here analysing
the Stop and Search data by Essex police to find the ethnicity
distribution in it and compare with the total population census
and Police workforce. This helps in finding if there is any bias
in the way that the police suspect a person at sight based on
ethnicity before they stop and search. To know if there are
dominating races employed in police workforce that might lead
to bias, the Essex police workforce data is taken into account
for comparison. All these data from each set is correlated to
find any evidence that shows the Police being prejudice in their
inspections. Machine learning models are used in this case to
analyse the bias in an algorithmic perspective. The data that we
have is used to create a model and train test it by implementing
AI Fairness 360 (aif360) toolkit to detect and eliminate bias in
our machine learning model. This software toolkit is helpful in
mitigating and reducing bias and leads us to understand the bias
in the data. Based on the output we get from the model, it is
possible to cross validate and check how inclined the data is
towards any community.
